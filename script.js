//task 1 - 
//1.1: review the code base so that you can explain generally what each line is doing and create a simple diagram illustrating the basic flow.
//1.2: change the colour of the target object from red to green
//1.3: improve the game by updating the target's fixed location so that it is generated randomly during the setup
//1.4: complete the code blocks associated with controlling the snake's direction of tavel; i.e., paint_snake and keypressed functions review the switch instruction.. 
//1.5: update the collision function so that it detects and stops the game if the snake goes outside the width of the viewport; you can use noLoop() to do this as a quick fix
//1.6: update the collision function so that it detects and stops the game if the snake goes outside the height of the viewport
//1.7: reflect, plan and create a function called 'reset' that resets the snake and restarts the action (as if you were to 'refresh' the page).
//1.8: update the target_collected function so that it correctly detects and returns true if the snake 'hits' the target; by returning true the snake will automatically grow 
//1.9: update the target_collected function so that if the snake 'hits' the target the target is removed and repositioned at a new (random) location
//1.10: reflect, plan and create some general improvements, this could include some kind of scoring mechanism (e.g., time based, target based, etc), what else could you do
